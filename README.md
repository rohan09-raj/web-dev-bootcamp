There are various platforms on which you can deploy your website. Here we will be using `https://render.com/`

## **Step-1**
Sign in with GitHub and once you're signed in, you will be directed to dashboard.

## **Step-3**
If you have signed in with GitHub, you will be able to see your repositories.
One thing to keep in mind, you have create your own Git repository and push it to GitHub, then only you will be able to see it here.

If you are able to find your repository, click on `Connect`

If you are not able to find your repository in the list, go to your repository and copy the repository link from the `Code` dropdown

- Branch name can be different here according to your repository, it can be `master`, `develop` or anything which you have set. You will be able to find it here, see the first element in below screenshot, so mine is `main` therefore I have put `main` in the form, you can put yours accordingly

- Next is root directory, it can vary according to the folder structure and nesting of yours, here I have two folders nested and then my React code is there, that's why I have mentioned the path `./Day4-React/tutorial`, you can mention according to yours. Generally your code will lie on root directory, therefore, you can leave it `blank`, something as shown in below image
